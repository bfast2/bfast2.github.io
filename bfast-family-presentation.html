# BFAST family of break detection algorithms

---

# Algorithms

* BFAST Monitor (`bfastmonitor()`)/`bfastSpatial`
  * 1 break at the end of the time series
* BFAST0N (`bfast0n()`/`breakpoints()`)
  * All breaks in the time series, without decomposition
  * Can handle many `NA`s, order of magnitude slower than Monitor
* BFAST (`bfast()`)
  * All breaks in the time series, with decomposition
  * Cannot handle (many) NAs, order of magnitude slower than BFAST0N
* BFAST01 (`bfast01()`/`bfast01classify()`)
  * One break in the time series, change classes

# BFAST0N

* `bfast0n()`, a wrapper around `bfastpp()`+`strucchange::breakpoints()`
* `strucchange::breakpoints(formula, data, h)`
  * `data`: any data.frame/matrix with numbers or `ts`
  * `formula`: e.g. `response ~ trend + harmon`
  * `h`: minimum segment size, either fraction of the time series length or integer defining the number of samples
* Output: `breakpointsfull` that indicates breakpoint timing and confidence interval, in sample numbers (mapping to `data`)

---

# Principle of `breakpoints()`

* Piece-wise linear regression:
  * Given that we want one break, what’s the optimal location to put it so that the RSS of two segments is minimised?
  * What if we want two breaks?
  * Etc. etc. to get a triangular matrix of possible breaks and model RSS
* But how many breaks does the time series have?
  * An Information Criterion: if we increase degrees of freedom by adding breaks, data will fit better, so penalise for each degree of freedom added
  * AIC (k=2) is too weak, BIC (k=log(n)) is also often too weak
  * LWZ (k=0.299 × log(n)^2.1) seems to do better
* BIC used in `breakpoints()` by default for backwards compatibility, `bfast0n()` may use LWZ

# `bfastpp()`

* How do you get data in a format where you can use `formula = response ~ trend + harmon`?
* `bfastpp(ts, order)`: preprocessing of time series
  * `ts` must be a `ts` object with frequency > 1
  * `order` is the harmonic order

# bfastpp output

Output is a data.frame with components:

# `bfast()`

BFAST: decomposition of time series into season, trend and irregular components

![](bfast-output.png)

---

# BFAST

* AKA "Original BFAST"
* Uses breakpoints() to detect univariate breaks on each individual component, thus separate season and deseasonalised trend breaks
* Iterative approach, process run multiple times (can override)
* Gives an indication of magnitude (difference between fitted trend values between segments) and specifically the largest break too
* No Spatial equivalent: reported breaks are not constant, so hard to put into raster layers
  * If h = 1 year, then can output one layer per year, saying whether there was a break detected or not, and when
